# Vehical-Rental-App
 I created an app that presents concepts specific to OOP in Java which includes : Encapsulation, Inheritance , Polymorphism, Overriding, Abstraction. The project is a vehicle 
 rental application where you can log in as a staff member (administrator) or existing customer or you can create a new account as a customer. The application has a menu 
 in which you can find options such as: viewing the current list of vehicles, renting a vehicle, rental history, adding vehicles, etc.
